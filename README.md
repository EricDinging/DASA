- [ ] 26 Feb -- Finish inventory and start to buy parts
- [ ] 10 Mar -- First checkpoint

## Motor control
Forward, backward, left turn, right turn, stand-still rotate
### Components
1. Nucleo L4R5ZIP
2. 12VDC, 200rpm, 0.78Kg-cm GHM-16 (w/ rear shaft)
3. L298 H-Bridge heavy duty w/breakout
### Implement
1. Nucleo control H-bridge logic input (direction of spin)
2. Nucleo control motor speed through PWM via H-bridge Vs (spinning speed)
